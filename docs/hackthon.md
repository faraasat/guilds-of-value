# MNEE Hackathon: Programmable Money for Agents, Commerce, and Automated Finance

## Overview

The MNEE Hackathon: Programmable Money for Agents, Commerce, and Automated Finance invites developers, builders, and innovators to shape the next era of digital commerce and autonomous coordination.

Money is becoming programmable — not just for humans, but for AI agents, online communities, businesses, and decentralized networks. This hackathon challenges teams to build real applications where value moves automatically, transparently, and reliably.

Using MNEE, a USD-backed stablecoin live on Ethereum, participants will create systems that enable:

AI agents to transact and pay for services autonomously

Creators and businesses to accept stablecoin payments

Smart contracts to automate financial workflows and settlements

The goal: Design the future of commerce infrastructure — stable, programmable, and accessible to everyone.

Whether you’re an AI engineer, web3 developer, fintech builder, or designer shaping user experiences, this hackathon is your platform to build tools that power the next generation of economic interactions.
