# Guilds of Value”

## One-line Pitch (VERY IMPORTANT)

> **A decentralized bounty & reputation network where people, AI agents, and guilds compete to solve real-world problems for stablecoin rewards.**

## Core System (Refined & Simplified)

### Bounties (Core Primitive)

Anyone can post a bounty using **MNEE**:

- Lost & found
- Information gathering
- Research
- On-chain/off-chain tasks
- Moderation & dispute resolution
- Data labeling / verification
- AI evaluations

Each bounty includes:

- Reward in MNEE
- Conditions for completion
- Deadline
- Optional escrow rules

### Bounty Hunters (Humans + AI Agents)

Hunters can be:

- Humans
- AI agents
- Hybrid (human-supervised agents)

Each hunter has:

- Wallet
- Rank
- Trust score
- Completion history
- Guild affiliation (optional)

> This is emotionally powerful: **people are no longer anonymous freelancers — they are ranked problem-solvers.**

### Guilds

Guilds are **economic coordination units**, not just social groups.

Guilds:

- Recruit hunters
- Stake MNEE as collateral
- Earn a percentage of completed bounties
- Build reputation over time

Guild rankings are based on:

- Completion success
- Dispute resolution rate
- Community participation
- Hunter quality
- Staked MNEE (skin in the game)

> Emotionally: _“Belonging + status + money.”_
> Economically: _“Trust at scale.”_

## Talent Transfer Contracts

- Buyout / transfer contracts
- Guild A pays Guild B in MNEE
- Hunter opts in
- Smart contract enforces cooldowns & fees

This mirrors **sports transfers**, which feels intuitive and ethical.

## 🤖 AI Hunters

AI agents can:

- Monitor bounties
- Automatically claim suitable tasks
- Perform:

  - Web research
  - On-chain analysis
  - Data aggregation
  - Monitoring & alerts

- Submit results

They:

- Have wallets
- Spend MNEE for APIs, tools, or data
- Earn MNEE on completion

## AI Guild Managers

Each guild can deploy:

- An AI agent that:

  - Assigns bounties to hunters
  - Prices hunter transfers
  - Flags disputes
  - Optimizes payouts

These agents:

- Are funded by the guild treasury in MNEE
- Are accountable on-chain

## Creator Bounties

Creators & businesses can:

- Post bounties for:

  - Content creation
  - Moderation
  - Research
  - Community growth

- Pay in MNEE
- Track delivery automatically

This becomes:

> **“Upwork + DAO + AI agents”**

## Guild Pages as Commerce Hubs

Each guild has:

- Public profile
- Performance metrics
- “Hire this guild” button
- Subscription or retainer option (monthly MNEE payments)

Now guilds are **sellable service providers**.

## Automated Escrow

- Bounties auto-lock MNEE
- Funds released:

  - On completion
  - On majority community approval
  - Via AI verification

- Disputes trigger arbitration rules

## Guild Treasuries

Guilds have:

- Shared MNEE treasuries
- Automated revenue splits:

  - Hunter
  - Guild
  - Referrer

- Performance-based bonuses

## Recurring Bounties

Businesses can set:

- Weekly/monthly bounties
- Automatically funded in MNEE
- Auto-renewed

## ⚠️ Critical Advice (Very Important)

**DO NOT build the entire ecosystem.**

### Hackathon MVP Should Be:

- Bounty posting (MNEE escrow)
- Guild creation
- Hunter profiles
- One AI agent completing a bounty
- Automated payout

That’s it.

You sell the **vision**, not the full platform.

NOTE: This is a very basic idea. I can help you refine it, but the core concept is solid. Also the UI must be very modern and elegant and look like NFT/Web3 apps with sci-fi feel and touch.
